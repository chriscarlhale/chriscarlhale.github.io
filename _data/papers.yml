  title: "Second-Language Learning for Students with Special Needs: Perceptions of Japanese Secondary School Teachers"
  subtitle: 
  journal: Accents Asia , vol.11 (2) (p.78 - 83)
  date: 2019/09
  author: Chris Carl Hale, Satoko Ono
  desc: This paper presents preliminary research into how Japanese teachers of English (JTEs) perceive their readiness in addressing the needs of students with learning disabilities, and what specific concerns they may have in ensuring a productive and healthy classroom learning environment for everyone. Using a qualitative, inductive research design, teacher perceptions were collected from open-ended questionnaires, which were then coded and analyzed. It was hoped that results could inform a needs analysis for teachers wishing to become more informed about learning disabilities and methods for best teaching these students.
