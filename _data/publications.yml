  title: "Transforming university English with CLIL curricula: An in-depth case study"
  desc: "How will universities throughout Japan meet future challenges of enhancing students' English academic skills to achieve MEXT goals, prepare students for study abroad and EMI courses at home, and boost overall international English-language competitiveness? Adopting CLIL-based curricula is one promising solution. Based on a four-year MEXT grant to researchers at four major universities, this article describes action-research curricular reform of a first-year English program with 230 students. Its research objective was to design an effective content-based curriculum to improve academic readiness for study in English and significantly boost TOEFL scores."
